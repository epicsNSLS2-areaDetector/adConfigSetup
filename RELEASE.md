# adConfigSetup Releases

Author: Jakub Wlodek  

### R1-0 - October 26, 2018

Initial release for ad Config Setup. The script has been tested and was able to successfully set-up the configuration files automatically to allow for 
compilation of ADSupport, ADCore, and any AD Driver provided that the driver's dependencies are met beforehand.  

### Future improvements:

* Ability to generate and/or replace macros that are initially commented out.
* Sets of example files for certain driver+plugin combinations
* Improvements to the autoSetupAD.sh script to automatically install driver dependancies as well.
